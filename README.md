> [!WARNING]
> Do not clone this repository directly into your `userplugins` folder. This will not work

To install these plugins, you need to copy the `index.ts` file from each plugin folder into your `userplugins` folder. 

Please follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the plugin folder (e.g. [`GlobalBadges`](./GlobalBadges/))
2. Download the `PluginName.ts` file and copy it to your `userplugins` folder
3. Open your Terminal in the Root Folder of Vencord and run `pnpm build`
